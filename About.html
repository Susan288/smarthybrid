        <h2>Solar-Wind Smart Hybrid Street Lighting System Monitored by IoT</h2>
        <p>
            This project involves a smart hybrid street lighting system that utilizes solar and wind energy to power street lights. 
            The system is designed to be monitored through the Internet of Things (IoT) for real-time tracking and management.
        </p>
        <p>
            The system integrates a PIR sensor for motion detection, which ensures that the street light turns on only when objects are detected. 
            This enhances energy efficiency by preventing unnecessary light usage. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) sensor automatically turns the light on or off based on the surrounding light intensity. 
            This ensures the street lights are active only during nighttime, contributing to further energy conservation.
        </p>
        <p>
            The IoT monitoring system provides detailed information on battery status, solar, wind, load power, and the current and voltage of all three components. 
            This allows for real-time adjustments and performance optimization.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ultimately, the system maximizes energy efficiency by minimizing energy wastage, making it an ideal solution for smart city applications.
